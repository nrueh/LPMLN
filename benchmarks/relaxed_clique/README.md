# Relaxed clique

This directory contains everything related to the Relaxed Clique benchmark which has been taken from  [[1]](#1) and used for comparison to their system. The encoding can be found in `relaxed_clique.lp`. The directory `az_instances` contains the original instances used in that paper. In the folder `runtimes` the two files starting with `runtime_az_instance_SYSTEM.csv` contain the runtimes on these instances with our system and a newer version of the system from [[1]](#1). We visualized the results from both files in two graphs (`figures/relaxed_clique_az_instances_SYSTEM.png`).
